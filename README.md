## The what and the why of *Coding Nature*    
(Our Genius, Joy, and Love Academy Student Workshop)

## Intro to basic coding and Open Fuego

## README: Getting Started working with Open Fuego


2. Click the green "**Code**" button at the top of this repository and then "Download ZIP" to your local computer. 

3. Find this folder in your downloads. Open Zip and move this folder to "**My Files**." You will return to this folder to manage your scripts and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

4. Download and open a text editor like [atom.io](https://atom.io), or [notepad-plus-plus.org](http://notepad-plus-plus.org) for Macs and Windows, or [CodePad](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-pad-text-editor/adaepfiocmagdimjecpifghcgfjlfmkh?hl=en-GB) for Chromebooks.  

5. Use the text editor to open the index.html document from your project folder.  

6. Start working with code by reading through the index.html where you'll find instructions on how to build your own webtext! We'll use these [common assets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P6GpBebWcUzDgFXIQAxZjCfKZ1tUKvlm?usp=sharing) to customize your webtext.

7. Once you have modified and added your files to your project file, you will want to publish to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext. Click  "uploading an existing file," (push) your files into this repository. You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. Upload assets, then hit "Commit changes." 

8. Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" and change the setting from "none" to "main." Hit "Save."

9. This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

10. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.

##Interview/discussion Recording

* Download [Hi-Q MP3 Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hiqrecorder.free&hl=en_US&gl=US) from the Chrome App Store
* Set record to MP3
* Partner-up and record your discussion about the importance of this Genius, Joy, and Love Seminar
* When finished, click the share button.
* Save the MP3 to your project file.<p>&nbsp;</p>


## Sharing Out

Once you have published your webtext to GitHub, let's [share the URL.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLCIP0wljm6kKVbXDGSZPpv5pacEmqJ7hz16LK-L6Q7T2-DA/viewform?usp=sf_link)<p>&nbsp;</p>


## Reflection

* Is coding in our nature?
* Does everyone learn a little about code?
* When we talk about a healthy environment to live, learn, and work, should we also be talking about access to technology and data science?
* * How do citizens use data and code to advocate for social justice in their community?
* Is their value in intertwining coding education with social justice education?
* Are there any dangers as to how student observations might be shared?
* What jobs could this be useful in?
* How else can schools better ensure that everyone has a voice in the conversation about technology and data?
